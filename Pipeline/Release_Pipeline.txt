# Build Pipeline (which is Continous Integration)
# Release Piepline (which is continous Delivery)
-> We deploy the code and generate the artifact(Build Pipeline), we have pass this artifact 
to each environment like each stages (DEV,QA,STAGE,PROD) to deploy same code but give
app services in running

# AZURE PIPELINE
-> CI is used to automate tests and build for projects and it used to find bug or any other 
issues in this CI phase.
-> CD is used to automatically deploy and test code in multiple stages like (dev,qa,uat,stage
prod...) (Release Pipeline)
After building our project, We have to pass our build across different environments
Stages means different environment (Organization need they may maintain different number of ENV)
So we have deploy those code and changes to different environments.
At the end of release we have to go for production release.
We have to create Release pipeline for each environments.

#What is Stage?
