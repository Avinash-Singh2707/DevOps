Agent Pools -> This is the place where you need to configure your own VM or any other
virtual machine on which you want to build your application.
So I created a pool and added Agent.

-> You need to add your own VM as an agent, when you need to run and deploy ur application

What is Agent?-> Agent is an Individual machine that can process pipelie jobs. When a 
pipeline job is triggered, Azure DevOps selects an available agent from the pool to run the 
job.

---------
An agent is a piece of software that runs the pipelines, allowing you to execute build,
test and deployment task.
There are two modes to run an Azure DevOps agent:
1. Service Mode: This is the default mode.When the agent is installed, it runs as a service
in the background without requiring user intreaction.It's ideal for long-runnung task and servers.
2. Interactive Mode: This mode allows you to run the agent interactively, which means it requires
a user to be logged in, and tasks can be monitored directly through terminal or CLI.
It doesn't run in the background like a service.Running in interactive mode is useful 
when debugging tasks or testing configuration locally.

# Why Interactive Mode?-> Debugging, User-Interaction, Testing on local machine
----------------------------------
#ADO AGENT: are software components that run jobs from your Azure Pipeline. An agent is a 
tool that executes tasks defined in a pipeline.An agent is a tool that executes tasks defined
in a pipelin, such as compiling code, running tests, and deploying applicatios. The agent is
responsible for carrying out the steps of the pipeline by using the machine resources on which
it is installed.
-> Types of ADO agent:

A. Mircrosoft-Hosted Agents:These are managed by microsoft and run in the cloud.
2. You don't need to worry about setting up the environment or maintaining the agent.
3.However, you might have limited control over the environment, and the builds migh take longer
depending on availability,
4.Ideal for projects that don't require specific software or customization in the agent environment.

B. Self-Hosted Agents:These agents run on machines that you own and manage, either on premises
or in the cloud.
2.You can configure this machine with specific software tools, or configuration that your project
needs.
3.Provides full control over the environment but requires maintenance and monitoring of the agent.

#How ADO agents WORK?
-> When a pipeline is triggered in Azure DevOps, it needs an agent to execute the tasks.
-> The pipeline sends the jobs to an agent, and the agent carries out the steps, reporting back the result.
-> Agents can be configured to run jobs on specific OS (Win,Linux,MacOS) depending on the project requirements

#Key features:
-> Scalability:You can have multiple agents working in parallel to speed up your pipelines.
-> Customization: With self-hosted agent, you can install any software required for your builds.
-> Security: Agent can run in isolated environments with appropriate security policies.

# Use cases for ADO Agents:
-> Build Automation: Compiling source code, running tests and producing binaries.
-> CI/CD: Automating the entire pipeline for building,testing and deploying applications.
-> Custom Envionments: Self hosted agents allow for highly specific software and hardware configurations.

In short, ADO agents are the workhorses that execute pipeline task and are critical for running
automated processes in ADO.
