Production Server -> FTP
Development Server -> 
Log file, Any folder you miss

-> BUNCH of file update on server. Same time to update

First we need code repository -> where we store code in one centralised manner
Continous Integration ->
Continous Delivery/Developement ->
System build the code and test-> Agent

#Below are the tools we can build CI/CD pipeline
// JENKIN is tool help to setup server,build-in testing and deployment
// AZURE Pipelines -> 
// GitHub Actions -> 

-----Navin Reddy---------
Waterfall model-> 1Year
Agile -> 2-3month -> Intergarion all module -> some test may get failed
CI -> Modules Continous integration (Write,Commit and TEST)
So every project is tested and confident this project is working.

Continuous Delivery : Making it available for the deployment. (MOCK SERVER)
Mimick those thing how ur project is running on mock server.

Continous Deployemnt:(Bit-Scary), the moment you commit a code,
after automation testing, your code Directly deploy on the production server.
